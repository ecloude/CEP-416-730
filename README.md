# Teaching and Learning with Technology

In CEP416, we will explore classroom technology integration. The goal of this course is to help you learn and reflect on how to teach with technology. Technology changes over time, and policies governing its use in schools tend to vary. As a result, this course focuses on pedagogical skills that you will be able to apply to multiple educational contexts; you will have many hands-on opportunities to evaluate and use popular classroom technologies. You will complete CEP416 with a better understanding of how to implement technology in your classroom; over the course of the semester you will develop an electronic Web Portfolio showcasing your growing skills and knowledge in this area.
